# Project Description 
A scalable React Native e-commerce application built with Expo, TypeScript, and Firebase. Designed for seamless browsing, shopping cart functionality, and secure user authentication.

## Key Features

- **TypeScript + Expo** — cross-platform support for iOS and Android  
- **Firebase integration** — real-time authentication & cloud database  
- **Context-based state management** — leveraging React Context API for global cart & auth states  
- **Modular component architecture** — reusable UI components for clean and maintainable code  
- **Custom Hooks** — simplifying and abstracting data logic  
- **Screens** — structured views including Home, Product Details, Cart, Checkout, Login, Register  

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to launch the app locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VictorIBK123/TechhGadgetStore.git
cd TechhGadgetStore
npm install
```

1. Update firebase-config.ts with your Firebase project credentials.


2. Run the development server:



```bash
npx expo start
```

3. Scan the QR code with Expo Go or run it on an emulator.
